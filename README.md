# blackjack

Simple text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. The goal of this project is to simulate a Blackjack game using user inputs in Python. 

Rules of blackjack: A player is dealth cards and must get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. 
- The player and dealer are dealt two cards each at the beginning
- The player can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep the current hand)
- The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher
- The player wins if their hand is close to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21

## Implementation & Usage

This project is implemented using a Python class named Blackjack. Within this class we have attributes that store the dack we draw from as well as the dealer hand and player hand. After the setup is complete we run the play function to simulate a blackjack game scenario.

In order to run the Blackjack implementation execute the following command in terminal. 

```
python3 blackjack.py 
```
